                  In order to better visualize just how many airbnbs tend to pop up in close proximity to hotels,
                  we chose to have a closer look at the hotels which
                  <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Neighborhood-g60763-n7102356-Upper_East_Side-New_York_City_New_York.html#MAPVIEW"><i>TripAdvisor</i></a>
                  regards as the highest-rated hotels per neighbourhood.
                  The plot can identify the hotels in Manhattan that have experienced the most competition in terms of the density of airbnbs within 500m of each hotel.
                  This radius was selected to visualize the theory of the agglomeration perspective,
                  which states that “spillovers from adjacent competitors pull firms close to similar competitors” (C. Baum et. al, 1997).

                  This was help assist the identification how much competition different hotels faces in its close proximity for each neighbourhood. The lower density and higher
                  familiarity score is due to the use of  a real map allowing a user to understand the locations of our variables better.

                Based on the observations in the first two plots, plot three was produced to graphically represent the number of airbnbs that have popped up in Manhattan between 2009 and 2019.
                Focusing on the development of five neighbourhoods that have experienced the highest growth rate of airbnbs.
                This excluded neighbourhoods such as Harlem, which despite experiencing the most growth of airbnbs as a neighbourhood,
                did not pose direct competition to hotels since only one was located in the area.

                  When creating Plot 3 we had identified which areas faced the highest number of airbnbs in their proximity and wanted to understand

                  neighbourhood and including filtered data showing different attribute, the familiarity and density score is high.

            Our interactive charts for tabs 1 and 3 show how Airbnbs gain traction over time, while the chart in tab 2 serves to dive deeper into
            the extent to which popular hotels are victims of the agglomeration perspective described earlier. Our main observations, mainly derive
            from a combination of the first and third charts. First we determined what areas of Manhattan have experienced the highest growth of Airbnbs
            throughout the recent years, then in our third tab, we investigate those neighbourhoods further, by filtering on different Airbnb attributes:<br>
            </li>
            <li><P class="w3-left-align">
            - Entire homes/apartments<br>
            - Private Rooms<br>
            - Airbnbs with availability less than 100 days per year<br>
            - Airbnbs with availability more than 100 days per year<br>
            - Airbnbs with a minimum stay of fewer than thirty days<br>
            - The most competitive Airbnbs to the Hotel association<br>
            (comprised of points 1, 4 and 5 above as this combination resembles hotel attributes and target segment most closely)<br>
            </li></p>
            <li><P class="w3-left-align">
            What’s interesting about these graphs is that they allow us to identify specific changes in time of airbnb development,
            which can be further linked it to real life events (examples shown in graph) and help the hotel association understand
            the impact of lobbying activities. As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/technology/new-york-passes-law-airbnb.html"><b>The New York Times</b></a>,
            “New York state in October 2016 passed some of the toughest restrictions on short-term rentals in the country. In most of New York City,
            it's now illegal to advertise or rent an entire apartment on a platform like Airbnb for less than 30 days unless the host is present and there
            are only one or two guests”.<br>
            </li></p>
            <li><P class="w3-left-align">
            Although none of our graphs show the exact combination of the conditions/attributes mentioned above, they do show the individual ones,
            and if we look at the vertical lines indicating when the legislation was passed, it does show that growth of Airbnbs slows down. Another article
            noted that “despite the prospect of increased fines, and a lower standard of proof for enforcement under the new law, between October and November,
            "Entire home/apartment" Airbnb listings dropped only 5.9%”. Moreover, the same article states that “for almost 1/3 of the Entire home/apartment listings
            that disappeared, the host simply changed the Airbnb "room type" to a "Private" or "Shared" room without changing anything else about the listing” (Cox, 2016).
            Despite the relatively low reduction in growth, our graph, along with the information above, does help the hotel association understand the effect that these
            legislation laws can have on the growth rate of airbnbs.

              <P class="w3-left-align">
                Looking at the interactive charts in tabs 1 and 3, there is a clear spike in airbnbs in
                the growth of airbnbs in the Financial District between 2018 and 2019, all seemingly centered
                around a block/building. We thought this observation was intriguing and found out that a <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/downtown-nyc/new-hospitality-start-backed-airbnb-coming-fidi">
                “hospitality start-up backed by Airbnb”</a> was recently <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/airbnb-backed-startup-plans-first-city-location-70-pine">
                launched</a> in the FiDi. The Airbnb backed
                hospitality company, Lyric may have found a loophole for NYC’s short letting legislation by taking out a
                long lease of a skyscraper in the FiDi and converting the apartments into short lets. Airbnb may continue
                to do the same if this loophole is not addressed as it would essentially allow them the benefits of operating
                as a hotel without the higher tax burden. Events like these are imperative for the Manhattan Hotel association
                to take note of, specifically because these types of airbnbs have the most competitive attributes (see tab 3 in Plot),
                and thus pose the highest competitive threat.

                As a result of the dataset we worked with, there are certain limitations. First of all, we compute
                the growth of airbnbs over time in all plots based on when an airbnb received its first review.
                This means that we had to exclude potential airbnbs that have zero reviews. Our dataset also does
                not report unlisting of airbnbs, so we cannot show when and if they potentially disappeared.
                At last, we were not able to tell if a host changed their listing type attributes after legislations
                were passed. However as mentioned earlier, this is something that did in fact widely occur.
